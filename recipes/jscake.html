    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A sweet dessert to bring for parties and celebrations such as Christmas!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Cake Flour</li>
      <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
      <li>Honey</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
      <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Baking Powder</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Strawberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Beat the egg yolks, sugar, salt, honey or corn syrup, vanilla, and water
        together until it becomes fluffy and a pale yellow color. The batter
        should form a ribbon when dropped from the whisk.
      </li>
      <li>
        The egg whites should be beaten to firm peaks, meaning the tips should
        fall but the meringue should hold its shape. Over beating the egg whites
        will result in a lumpy cake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add half of the egg whites to the egg yolk mixture and gently fold it,
        being careful not to deflate the egg white meringue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add the cake flour and baking powder to a fine mesh sieve and sift
        it into the egg white and egg yolk mixture. Add in the oil by first
        mixing it with 2 Tablespoons of the mixture and then gently fold in the
        remaining half of the egg white meringue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake them at 350 degrees F in parchment lined cake pans until golden
        brown on top and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>Slice even layers and brush on the sugar syrup on all layers.</li>
      <li>
        Add the whipped cream then add the strawberry slices on top. Cover the
        strawberries with another layer of whipped cream and add on a sponge
        cake layer. Keep repeating until you've used up all your cake layers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Frost the top and sides of the cake with whipped cream and decorate with
        whole strawberries. Dust the top with powdered sugar if desired and
        serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
